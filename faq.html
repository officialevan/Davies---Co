            <span class="c-faq__title">What are your areas of focus as a Creative Agency?</span>
            <div class="c-faq__answer">User experience is more than a capabilty for us. It's  at the core of everything we do here at Davies & Co. We started in Nairobi as a UI/UX design agency and website design agency
              focused on mobile apps but quickly expanded our services to brand and identity, Digital Marketing and customer experience. Projects that we take on range from building a product from scatch to redesigning
              an existing project. We do everything you might need to bring a successful digital product to life.

            <span class="c-faq__title">What separates Davies & Co. from other top creative design agencies?</span>
            <div class="c-faq__answer">We get this question alot especially from clients. There are many competent creative design agencies in Nairobi alone and even more globally. It's hard  to be different when the standard is so high.
              So how do we stand out? It's the quality that we bring to the table. How simple our digital products are to use. They are so human and client-centered.We rotate around the two. Most design agencies don't have that. We have a great team behind the scenes the designers, developers, project managers and other
              other specialists led by design directors and overseen by our co-founder.

          <li class="c-faq">
            <span class="c-faq__title">Can you help us redesign our legacy enterprise/B2B software?</span>
            <div class="c-faq__answer">Yes, we’re up to the challenge. We’re one of the few user experience firms specializing in
              enterprise UX design and digital transformation of legacy business software. We start each new enterprise UX
              project with a deep‑dive discovery and research to fully immerse ourselves in the
              industry and project specifics.
               
              We're a full-service digital agency and our services span from user research and
              information architecture, UX UI design, prototyping, and user testing to full‑stack
              development and design systems. Our UI UX design firm acts as an independent entity
              that moves fast, avoiding the bureaucracy of a large organization, often working
              hand‑in‑hand with innovation labs and in‑house UX teams.</div>
          </li>
          <li class="c-faq">
            <span class="c-faq__title">Do you do branding or should I hire a separate branding agency?</span>
            <div class="c-faq__answer">Yes, we do. First and foremost, we're a user experience agency, branding is an integral
              part of any UX UI design project. We position ourselves as a new kind of branding
              agency focused on tech companies, digital products, and direct‑to‑consumer brands.
              Not so many UX design agencies can create a visual identity for a coffee shop like we
              did for Joe & The Juice. Our branding capabilities include research, brand and digital
              strategy, logo design, visual identity, graphic design, motion design, and style guide
              development, and web design, among other things.
               
              However, our clients often provide us with either a brand strategy or even a complete
              visual identity package. In these cases, we use the current brand foundation as a
              starting point, not just carefully applying it to whatever we’re designing but making sure
              we extend and enrich the brand while staying true to its roots.

          </li>
          <li class="c-faq">
            <span class="c-faq__title">How much does it cost to hire you for a UI/UX design project?</span>
            <div class="c-faq__answer">Our pricing is directly related to the project scope, timeline, deliverables, and team
              composition. When the scope isn’t set in stone, or the project is very dynamic, we prefer
              engaging on a time and materials basis where you pay us for the time spent. However,
              most of our UX UI engagements are fixed‑price contracts. In this case, we’ll give you a
              detailed proposal after learning as much as possible about your project. All estimates
              are calculated based on the hourly rates and the number of hours we think the job will
              take.
               
              As an illustration, a sample project with a UX design agency may take ten weeks and
              cost 10k‑100k. For time and materials engagements, we would create a custom rate
              card for you based on the team composition. Our rates span from 200/hour for junior
              designers to 600/hour for our design directors. We also offer special rates for qualified
              startups. Please email us to get a quote.</div>

          <li class="c-faq">
            <span class="c-faq__title">What process should I expect from your UX agency?</span>
            <div class="c-faq__answer">Our UI/UX design process is based on the design thinking methodology, which allows
              us to be flexible, adapting to almost any project type and collaboration model. While
              each UX UI design engagement is unique, we always go through the following key
              phases:
               <br>
              <b>Discovery & Research</b><br>
              We usually start by consolidating all available project documentation and scheduling UX
              workshops with your team. During those sessions, we interview key stakeholders,
              collaborate on requirements, as well as ideate, and plan the next steps. When possible,
              our UX designers talk to your current or potential customers to understand their needs
              and pain points. In some cases, we may need to audit your existing product to identify
              opportunities for improvements to user experience. We will also review competitor
              products, gather visual design references, and document best practices.
              <br> 
              <b>Digital Strategy & Concepts</b><br>
              Based on the discovery & research results, we synthesize a digital strategy and define a
              UX approach to drive our design process. Since we're a UI/UX design agency, we will
              explore different concepts to establish such core elements as information architecture,
              key screen layouts, and UI design direction. We then validate the resulting concept with
              users and stakeholders. Once the feedback is in, we make necessary updates to
              proceed with designing the rest of the product.
               <br>
              <b>UI/UX Design</b><br>
              After the UI design concept has been approved, we start designing the UI and UX,
              continuously conducting user tests, and iterating along the way. The UX UI design main
              activities include user flow mapping, wireframing, user interface design, interaction
              design, and prototyping. We hand off design assets to developers using tools like Zeplin
              and provide a comprehensive style guide that includes a UI component library, UX
              guidelines, and complete user flows.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="c-faq c-faq">
            <span class="c-faq__title">How can I get a proposal for my project?</span>
            <div class="c-faq__answer">If you're looking for a UI/UX design agency, please send us an email first with a quick
              summary of your project or an RFI/RFP. We usually reply within 24 hours to schedule an
              introductory call and ask any immediate questions. During our first call, we will ask a lot
              of questions about the project goals, audience, budget, timeline, and other essential
              details. We can sign an NDA if necessary, but we always treat all client conversations as
              confidential. We recommend contacting several user experience design companies to
              compare their prices and UX UI approach.
               
              While many UI & UX design agencies only work by the hour, we try to estimate the
              project cost as precisely as possible before we start. After the call, we may request
              various documentation such as a design brief, project requirements, past designs, etc. If
              we’re redesigning an existing digital product, we’ll want to schedule a demo or try it
              ourselves.
               
              We will email you a proposal and can schedule a video call to walk you through it. The
              UX design agency proposal will include a detailed description of our UX UI approach,
              project phases, activities, and deliverables, design team composition, and relevant case
              studies.</div>
